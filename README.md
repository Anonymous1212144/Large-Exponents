Suppose after you died, you get to play a fun game in the afterlife where every person that has ever lived on Earth are all brought together and each of them think of a random atom in the universe, and you have to guess which atom it is. What is the chance of you getting them all correct? What if the number of people is an integer multiple of π and the number of atoms is an integer multiple of φ?

You might have the preposterous thought that this is not a common occurance, but someday you will need to calculate `6207145307999.2998046875 ^ -2852895446.646540164947509765625` and you'll be glad that you have to tool to figure out that it is approximately `1.267398993665 × 10^-36496783086`

Also, the chance is around 1 in 10^10^83:
